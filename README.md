## Roadmap

Options to add for data generation:
 - [ ] "Unknown date" option

 - [ ] Show summary of data that will be exported above "DOWNLOAD DATA" button: number of columns, number of rows, file size (?), etc.
 - [ ] Add options for number of records in preview.
 - [ ] Allow customising column name case (e.g., camel case, lowercase + underscores, etc.)
 - [ ] Add months and days in other languages.
 - [ ] Add ability to re-order columns (maybe in the preview?).
 - [ ] Add support for public holidays.
 - [ ] Export as SQL script that can generate the data.
